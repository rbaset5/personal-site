I specialize in the following:

Deploying data science projectsâ€”including interactive applications, notebooks, dashboards, and machine learning models with REST APIs. 
Utilizing data and industry specific knowledge to improve decision making and develop and maintain data products. 

In my data science portfolio, I retrieved data from outside sources and organized it using Python and created impactful  visualizations to present key findings. I explored data and wrote multiple hypotheses for further analysis and performed A/B tests. I also built machine learning APIs that produced results of an analysis that applied and used big data. After creating analyses, I developed collaborative techniques to better share conclusions about approaches and analyses to potential stakeholders. 



I am looking forward to leveraging my diverse experience and data science skills to help organizations succeed."""
